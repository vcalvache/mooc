Implement a program which calculates the factorial of a number given by the user.

Factorial of n, denoted n!, is calculated as 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n. For example, the factorial of 4 is 24 or 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24. Additionally, it has been specified that the factorial of 0 is 1, so 0! = 1.

Sample output:

    Sample output
        Give a number: 3
        Factorial: 6

The internal calculation here was 1 * 2 * 3 = 6

    Sample output
        Give a number: 10
        Factorial: 3628800

And now the internal calculation was 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * 8 * 9 * 10 = 3628800

Additional info: Factorials are used especially in probability calculus when examining different possible orders of a set. For example, a group of five people can form 5! different lines, and a pack of 52 cards can be in 52! different orders. Factorial can also be used to calculate combinations; For example it is possible to deal 52! / (5! * (52-5)!) different hands from a 52 card pack, and you can form 40! / (7! * (40 - 7)!) different 7 number lottery lines from 40 numbers.

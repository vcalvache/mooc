The program described here should be implemented in the class PersonalInformationCollection. NB! Do not modify the class PersonalInformation.

After the user has entered the last set of details (they enter an empty first name), exit the repeat statement.

Then print the collected personal information so that each entered object is printed in the following format: first and last names separated by a space (you don't print the identification number). An example of the working program is given below:

    Sample output
        First name: Jean
        Last name: Bartik
        Identification number: 271224
        First name: Betty
        Last name: Holberton
        Identification number: 070317
        First name:

        Jean Bartik
        Betty Holberton

Write a program that prompts the user for a number and informs us whether it is even or odd.

    Sample output
        Give a number:
        2
        Number 2 is even.

    Sample output
        Give a number:
        7
        Number 7 is odd.

Hint: The remainder when dividing by 2 tells us whether the number is even or not. We get the remainder using the %-operator. The exercise template contains additional instructions on how to do the checking using the remainder.

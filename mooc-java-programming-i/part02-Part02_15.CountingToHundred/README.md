Write a program, which reads an integer from the user. Then the program prints numbers from that number to 100. You can assume that the user always gives a number less than 100. Below are some examples of the expected functionality.

    Sample output
        99
        99
        100

    Sample output
        -4
        -4
        -3
        -2
        -1
        0
        1
        2
        ... (many numbers in between) ...

Write a program that reads user input until an empty line is entered. For each non-empty line the program splits the string by spaces and prints the last part of the string.

    Sample output
        one two three four
        four
        this is a very important message
        message

Tip! You can find out the length of the array like this:

    String[] parts = {"one", "two", "three"};
    System.out.println("Number of parts: " + parts.length);

    Sample output
        Number of parts: 3

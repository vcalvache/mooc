When a gift is given by a close relative or a family member, the amount of gift tax is determined by the following table (source vero.fi):

Value of gift	        Tax at the lower limit	Tax rate(%) for exceeding part
5 000 — 25 000	        100	                    8
25 000 — 55 000	        1 700   	            10
55 000 — 200 000	    4 700	                12
200 000 — 1 000 000	    22 100	                15
1 000 000 —	            142 100                 17

For example 6000€ gift implies 180€ of gift tax (100 + (6000-5000) * 0.08), and 75000€ gift implies 7100€ of gift tax (4700 + (75000-55000) * 0.12).

Write a program that calculates the gift tax for a gift from a close relative or a family member. This is how the program should work:

    Sample output
        Value of the gift?
        3500
        No tax!

    Sample output
        Value of the gift?
        5000
        Tax: 100.0

    Sample output
        Value of the gift?
        27500
        Tax: 1950.0

The exercise base contains the initial state of the previous example â€” it already includes the JUnit unit testing library. Follow the steps of the example, and use the principles of test-driven software development to give the wanted functionality for the exercise management program.

The exercise is in two parts:

    * Follow the steps of the example up until it's time to refactor the program and to create the class 'Exercise'. Create the classes ExerciseManagementTest and ExerciseManagement, and complete them with what the example instructs.
    * Follow the example all the way to the end. In other words, refactor the program as instructed.

Update the partsCompleted class method of the MainProgram to return the highest part that you have completed. You can return the exercise even if you don't complete the second part, in which case you will receive the point for the first one. Returning 2 means you have completed both.

If you desire to develop the program further (not awarded with points), you can try using test-driven development to first write a test (or a few) for removing exercises, and then implement that feature in your program. This is purely for your own amusement and is not reflected in the points in any manner!

Write a program that prompts the user to input their age and checks whether or not it is possible (at least 0 and at most 120). Only use a single if-command in your program.

    Sample output
        How old are you? 10
        OK

    Sample output
        How old are you? 55
        OK

    Sample output
        How old are you? -3
        Impossible!

    Sample output
        How old are you? 150
        Impossible!

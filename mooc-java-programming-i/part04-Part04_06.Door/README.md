Create a class named Door. The door does not have any variables. Create for it a constructor with no parameters (or use the default constructor). After that, create a public void knock() method for the door that prints the message "Who's there?" when called.

    The door should work as follows.

    Door alexander = new Door();

    alexander.knock();
    alexander.knock();

    Sample output
        Who's there?
        Who's there?

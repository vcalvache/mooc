A list is extremely useful for storing the values of variables for later use. That said, making mistakes is also relatively easy with a list.

There is a program that uses a list in the exercise template. Modify it so that its execution always produces the error IndexOutOfBounds. The user should not have to give any inputs to the program (e.g. write something on the keyboard)

You can also see a means for going through the values of a list â€” we will return to this topic a bit later.

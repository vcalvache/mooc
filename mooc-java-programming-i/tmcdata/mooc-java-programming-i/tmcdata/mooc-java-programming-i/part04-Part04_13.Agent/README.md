The exercise template defines an Agent class, having a first name and last name. A print method is defined for the class that creates the following string representation.

    Agent bond = new Agent("James", "Bond");
    bond.print();

    Sample output
        

Remove the class' print method, and create a public String toString() method for it, which returns the string representation shown above.

The class should function as follows.

    Agent bond = new Agent("James", "Bond");

    bond.toString(); // prints nothing
    System.out.println(bond);

    Agent ionic = new Agent("Ionic", "Bond");
    System.out.println(ionic);

    Sample output
        My name is Bond, James Bond
        My name is Bond, Ionic Bond

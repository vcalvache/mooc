Similar to the previous exercise, create a program that multiplies the values stored in two integer variables.

For instance, if the entered numbers are 2 and 8, the program should print the following:

    Sample output
        Give the first number:
        2
        Give the second number:
        8
        2 * 8 = 16

Likewise, if the entered numbers are 277 and 111, the print should be the following:

    Sample output
        Give the first number:
        277
        Give the second number:
        111
        277 * 111 = 30747

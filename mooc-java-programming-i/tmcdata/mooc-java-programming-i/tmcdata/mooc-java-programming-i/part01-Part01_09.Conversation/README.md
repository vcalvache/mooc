Write a program that works as follows:

    Sample output
    Greetings! How are you doing?
        Good thank you!
    Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!
        Well, there's really nothing to tell.
    Thanks for sharing!

    Sample output
    Greetings! How are you doing?
        Nice and dandy like cotton candy!
    Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!
        Just went shopping.
    Thanks for sharing!

The exercise template already includes the code that creates the Scanner tool.

import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Conversation {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

            //Write your program here
        }
    }

Implement a program, which calculates the sum 1+2+3+...+n where n is given as user input.

Sample output:

    Sample output
        Last number? 3
        The sum is 6

The previous example calculated 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

    Sample output
        Last number? 7
        The sum is 28

And this one calculated 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28

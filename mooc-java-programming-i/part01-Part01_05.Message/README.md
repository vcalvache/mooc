Write a program that asks the user to write a string. When the user has provided a string (i.e., written some text and pressed the enter key), the program should print the string that was provided by the user.

The exercise template comes with a program template that includes the creation of a Scanner tool.

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Message {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

            System.out.println("Write a message: ");
            // Write your program here
        }
    }

Example output for when the user writes "Bye".

    Sample output
        Write a message:
        Bye
        Bye

Example output for when the user writes "Once upon a time...".

    Sample output
        Write a message:
        Once upon a time...
        Once upon a time...

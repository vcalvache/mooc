Write a program that prompts the user for their name with the message "What's your name?". When the user has written their name, the program has to print "Hi " followed by the user's name.

The exercise template already includes the code that creates the Scanner tool.

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Greeting {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

            // Write your program here
        }
    }

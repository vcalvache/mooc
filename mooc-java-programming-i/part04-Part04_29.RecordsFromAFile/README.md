In this exercise, we'll be working with files stored in CSV-format that contain names and ages separated by commas. The file format may look like this:

    Sample data
        lily,3
        anton,5
        levi,4
        amy,1

Your task is to write a program that first prompts the user for the name of the file they want to read. The program then prints the content of the file in the following way (we're assuming below that the output is from the above-mentioned file):

    Sample output
        Name of the file:
        data.txt
        lily, age: 3 years
        anton, age: 5 years
        levi, age: 4 years
        amy, age: 1 year

NB! The word "year" should be formatted based on the age.

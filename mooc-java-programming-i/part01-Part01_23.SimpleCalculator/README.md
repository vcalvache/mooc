Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Two examples of the execution of the program are given below.

    Sample output
        Give the first number:
        8
        Give the second number:
        2
        8 + 2 = 10
        8 - 2 = 6
        8 * 2 = 16
        8 / 2 = 4.0

    Sample output
        Give the first number:
        9
        Give the second number:
        2
        9 + 2 = 11
        9 - 2 = 7
        9 * 2 = 18
        9 / 2 = 4.5

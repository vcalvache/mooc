Implement a program, which reads user input. If the user input is "end", the program stops reading input. The rest of the input is numbers. When the user input is "end", the program prints the average of all of the numbers.

Implement calculating the average using a stream!

    Sample output
        Input numbers, type "end" to stop.
        2
        4
        6
        end
        average of the numbers: 4.0

    Sample output
        Input numbers, type "end" to stop.
        -1
        1
        2
        end
        average of the numbers: 0.6666666666666666

Create a class called IOU which has the following methods:

    * constructor public IOU() creates a new IOU
    * public void setSum(String toWhom, double amount) saves the amount owed and the person owed to to the IOU.
    * public double howMuchDoIOweTo(String toWhom) returns the amount owed to the person whose name is given as a parameter. If the person cannot be found, it returns 0.

The class can be used like this:

    IOU mattsIOU = new IOU();
    mattsIOU.setSum("Arthur", 51.5);
    mattsIOU.setSum("Michael", 30);

    System.out.println(mattsIOU.howMuchDoIOweTo("Arthur"));
    System.out.println(mattsIOU.howMuchDoIOweTo("Michael"));

The code above prints:

    Sample output
        51.5
        30.0

Be careful in situations, when a person does not owe anything to anyone.

NB! The IOU does not care about old debt. When you set a new sum owed to a person when there is some money already owed to the same person, the old debt is forgotten.

    IOU mattsIOU = new IOU();
    mattsIOU.setSum("Arthur", 51.5);
    mattsIOU.setSum("Arthur", 10.5);

    System.out.println(mattsIOU.howMuchDoIOweTo("Arthur"));

    Sample output
        10.5
